# The Mysterious Prison
A sequel to The Mysterious Maze.
# About/Notes
All the sounds were made using jsfxr
Music was made using beepbox
CombatHUD.hx, GameOverState.hx, OptionsState.hx and Main.hx was copied from the HaxeFlixel tutorials.
Sorry for the horrible art skills! Yeah I can't even draw an arrow correctly...
# Story
You got stuck in a prison for no reason at all,
you have to escape to get back to you home. However...
There are Clawgers! These monsters can throw you back into your sell if you can't defeat them!
But there is a boss clawger too... Defeat him and you get to escape! (his minions wont know where the player is if he's defeated)
